Roadmap

* Turn off java script in untested browsers and all extrass
* Setup proper metadata depenging on page content
* Fix scroller partially disapearing in IE, when dragging
* In back button check handling functionreferer field. If it is outsite our domain,  
  dont go there, instead go back to default site page
* Make photos load after page load, so images loading wont extend overal page load time
* Make sure all stylesheets, ajavascripts and images are cache friendly - 
  focus on assed_id generated for joined stylesheets and javascripts. You must also solve 
  issues with images references from css (maybe link them in page header).
  If it is ok, extend expire times to one year.

    for pages which uses these menus.
  * Include template file lastmod time
* Add automaticaly agregated functional tests separated for each site
